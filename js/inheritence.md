// when you completely overwrite the prototype (as opposed to just augmenting it), this has some negative side effects on the constructor property.

// Inheriting the Prototype Only
// You gain a little more efficiency by:
// - Not creating a new object for the sake of inheritance alone, and
// - Having less lookups during runtime when it comes to searching for toString() for example.

/*
Simply copying the prototype is more efficient but it has a side effect: because all of the children and parents point to the same object, when a child modifies the prototype, the parents get the changes, and so do the siblings.
Look at this line:
Triangle.prototype.name = 'Triangle';
It changes the name property, so it effectively changes Shape.prototype.name too. If you create an instance using new Shape(), its name property will say "Triangle":

// A Temporary Constructorâ€”new F()
// A solution to the problem outlined above, where all prototypes point to the same object and the parents get children's properties, is to use an intermediary to 
// break the chain. The intermediary is in the form of a temporary constructor function. Creating an empty function F() and setting its prototype to the prototype of the 
// parent constructor, allows you to call new F() and create objects that have no properties of their own, but inherit everything from the parent's prototype
function Shape() { }
// augment prototype
Shape.prototype.name = 'shape';
Shape.prototype.toString = function () { return this.name; };
function TwoDShape() { }
// take care of inheritance
var F = function () { };

TwoDShape.prototype = new F();
TwoDShape.prototype.constructor = TwoDShape;
