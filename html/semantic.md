####-<nav> 
a section of navigation links, either to other pages (generally site navigation) or to sections on the same page (e.g. a table of contents for long articles). This is for major navigation blocks, not just for any group of links. It’s up to the author to decide what is major, but for example content highlights in the page’s footer probably wouldn’t qualify. (W3C:HTML, WHATWG)
#### <aside>
a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related TO — but separate from — the surrounding content. In print this would be a sidebar, pullquote or footnote. On a weblog article this could be article metadata in the margin or the comments section. (W3C:HTML, WHATWG)
#### <figure> 
for content that is essential to understanding, but can be removed from the document’s ‘flow’ (moved to a different place) without affecting the document’s meaning. This can be used for images or video, but it can also be used for any other content, including a graph, code sample, or other media. Caption <figure> with the optional (and delicious) child <figcaption>. (W3C:HTML, WHATWG)
#### <footer>  
a container element for additional information about a section, such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, a link to the top of the page etc, that usually appears at the end of a section. <footer> can’t contain nested <header> or <footer> elements—use a <section> instead for complex footers that need nested <section>s with <header>s etc. (W3C:HTML, WHATWG)
