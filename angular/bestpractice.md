## Directive
-  Prefer using the dash-delimited format (e.g. ng-bind for ngBind). If you want to use an HTML validating tool, you can instead use the data-prefixed version (e.g. data-ng-bind for ngBind). The other forms shown above are accepted for legacy reasons but we advise you to avoid them.
-  Prefer using directives via tag name and attributes over comment and class names. Doing so generally makes it easier to determine what directives a given element matches.
-  Comment directives were commonly used in places where the DOM API limits the ability to create directives that spanned multiple elements (e.g. inside <table> elements). AngularJS 1.2 introduces ng-repeat-start and ng-repeat-end as a better solution to this problem. Developers are encouraged to use this over custom comment directives when possible.
-  In order to avoid collisions with some future standard, it's best to prefix your own directive names. For instance, if you created a <carousel> directive, it would be problematic if HTML7 introduced the same element. A two or three letter prefix (e.g. btfCarousel) works well. Similarly, do not prefix your own directives with ng or they might conflict with directives included in a future version of Angular.
- Use controller when you want to expose an API to other directives. Otherwise use link.
