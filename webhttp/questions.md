There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers:
- **Quirks mode**: In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. 
- **Full standards mode** : In full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. 
- **Almost standards mode** : In almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.
